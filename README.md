# Text-Editor-in-Python-
we will create a GUI-based Text Editor using only the Tkinter module in Python.A notepad is a text-only editor that only works with .txt files but can still read and edit file formats that can be edited. This project is a very simple one to make, but you are still going to have a lot of fun creating it.
Project Prerequisites:
To build this text editor in python, we will need the following libraries:

1. Tkinter – To create the GUI.
2. PIL (Python Image Library) – To give the GUI window an icon.
3. OS – To get the path of the file.
